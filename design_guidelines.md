# Giannone Foods Construction Page Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from playful construction/maintenance pages with Italian food branding elements. The design balances professional construction messaging with warm, inviting food industry aesthetics.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors (Italian Flag Theme)**
- Deep Forest Green: 120 35% 25% (primary brand)
- Warm White: 0 0% 98% (backgrounds, text)

**Supporting Colors**
- Construction Orange: 25 90% 60% (construction elements)
- Warm Gray: 20 8% 85% (subtle backgrounds)
- Dark Charcoal: 220 10% 15% (text, shadows)

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts) - clean, modern
- **Display Font**: Poppins (Google Fonts) - friendly headlines
- **Hierarchy**: Large construction message (2xl-4xl), logo prominence, subtitle text (lg-xl)

### Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing Primitives**: Use units of 4, 8, 16, and 24 for consistent spacing
- Generous padding (p-8, p-16) for breathing room
- Strategic margins (m-4, m-8) between elements
- Component spacing (gap-4, gap-8) for logical grouping

### Component Library
**Core Elements**:
- Prominent logo display with subtle shadow
- Large construction message in both Portuguese and English
- Animated construction worker illustrations
- Progress indicator or estimated completion timeline
- Contact information footer

## Visual Treatment

### Gradients and Backgrounds
- Subtle radial gradient from warm white to light gray
- Optional diagonal construction stripe patterns (very subtle)
- Soft shadows and depth for floating elements

### Construction Theme Integration
- Playful construction worker characters scattered in background
- Hard hat, tools, scaffolding elements as decorative graphics
- Caution tape borders or accents (sparingly used)
- Construction site aesthetic without overwhelming food branding

## Page Structure
**Single Viewport Design** (Maximum 3 sections):
1. **Hero Section**: Logo + main construction message
2. **Information Section**: Timeline/contact details (optional)
3. **Footer**: Minimal contact information

## Images
**Hero Background**: Large hero image/illustration featuring animated construction workers building/working around the Giannone Foods logo. The workers should be cartoon-style, friendly characters using construction tools. The background should be subtle enough to not compete with the logo and text.

**Logo Placement**: Giannone Foods logo prominently centered in the hero section, ensuring high contrast against the construction worker background.

## Key Design Principles
- **Warmth meets Construction**: Balance industrial construction theme with welcoming Italian food warmth
- **Logo Prominence**: Ensure the Giannone Foods logo is the dominant visual element
- **Playful Professionalism**: Construction workers should be charming and approachable, not intimidating
- **Minimal Distractions**: Keep animations subtle to maintain focus on the brand message
- **Mobile-First**: Ensure construction characters and logo scale beautifully on all devices
